CoV_S2_C	PF19214	Coronavirus spike glycoprotein S2, intravirion	This entry represents the cysteine rich intravirion region found at the C-terminus of coronavirus spike proteins (S) [1]. These cysteine residues are targets for palmitoylation, necessary for efficiently S incorporation into virions and S-mediated membrane fusions.
CoV_NSP2_N	PF19211	Coronavirus replicase NSP2, N-terminal	This entry corresponds to the N-terminal region of coronavirus non-structural protein 2. NSP2 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. Viral-host protein interaction studies in SARS-CoV and SARS_CoV-2 found that this protein could interact with several host proteins including prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2, which are implicated in a number of cellular functions, including cellular migration, differentiation and apoptosis [2,3]. NSP2 structure from SARS-CoV-2 has been recently solved and revealed that it has three zinc fingers, covered in this entry, which may be involved in binding nucleic acids and regulating intracellular signalling pathways [2].
CoV_NSP13_stalk	PF20633	Coronavirus Nonstructural protein 13, stalk domain	Helicase nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13) is encoded by the replicase polyprotein 1a/ab of coronaviruses and released after a proteolytic process. It plays a critical role catalysing the unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in a NTP-dependent manner. It is a multidomain protein consisting of a N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a stalk domain that connects the ZBD with the 1B domain and the helicase domain (that contains two RecA1 and RecA2 domains). The ZBD, stalk and 1B domains are unique to nidovirus helicases [1]. NSP13 adopts a triangular pyramid shape in which the two RecA1 and A2 and 1B domains form the triangular base while N-terminal ZBD and stalk domains are arranged at the apex of the pyramid [1,2]. Recently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 as an interferon antagonist [3]. This is the stalk domain.
CoV_S1_C	PF19209	Coronavirus spike glycoprotein S1, C-terminal	This entry represents a domain found at the C-terminus of the Coronavirus S1 protein. It is found across a range of alpha, beta and gamma coronaviruses. This small all beta stranded domain is known as subdomain 2 in the structure of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus spike protein [1].
B-CoV_A_NSP1	PF11963	Betacoronavirus, lineage A, NSP1	This family the N-terminal region of the Betacoronavirus polyprotein which contains non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) from Betacoronavirus lineage A. This protein is important for viral replication and pathogenesis [1,2]. It suppresses the host innate immune functions by inhibiting type I interferon expression and host antiviral signalling pathways.
Spike_torovirin	PF17072	Torovirinae spike glycoprotein	The spike glycoprotein is a corona viral transmembrane protein that mediates the binding of virions to the host cell receptor and is involved in membrane fusion. The torovirinae spike proteins appear distinct from other coronaviridae spike proteins, such as human SARS coronavirus [1]. This entry also includes some alloherpesvirus fusion glycoproteins.
CoV_Methyltr_2	PF06460	Coronavirus 2'-O-methyltransferase	This domain covers the NSP16 region of the coronavirus polyprotein. The SARS-CoV RNA cap SAM-dependent (nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) is a heterodimer comprising SARS-CoV nsp10 and nsp16. When bound to nsp10, nsp16 is active as a type-0 RNA cap-dependent 2'-O-MTase, ie., active only when the cap guanine is methylated at its N7 position. Nsp10 binds to nsp16 through an activation surface area in nsp10, and the resulting complex exhibits RNA cap (nucleoside-2'-O)-methyltransferase activity. Nsp10 is a double zinc finger protein together with nsp4, nsp5, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16, nsp10 has been found to be essential in the assembly of a functional replication/transcription complex. NSP16 plays a key role in viral replication as it is involved in immune response evasion through the 2'-O-methylation of coronavirus RNA, which is essential for preventing recognition by the host. It mimics the human protein CMTr1 and, unlike CMTr1, it requires NSP10 as a binding partner to activate its enzymatic activity [4]. Nsp16 adopts a typical fold of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase (SAM) family as defined initially for the catechol O-MTase but it lacks several elements of the canonical MTase fold, such as helices B and C. The nsp16 topology matches those of dengue virus NS5 N-terminal domain and of vaccinia virus VP39 MTases [1,2, 3]. Structural analysis in NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 identified a cryptic pocket (also present in other coronavirus such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) not present in human CMTr1, and the fact that NSP16 is one of the most conserved proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses, make it an interesting target for developing new antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and other diseases caused by coronaviruses [5].
bCoV_S1_N	PF16451	Betacoronavirus-like spike glycoprotein S1, N-terminal	This entry represents the N-terminal domain of the betacoronavirus-like trimeric spike glycoprotein. The distal S1 subunit of the coronavirus spike protein is responsible for receptor binding. S1 contains two domains; an N-terminal galectin-like domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD) also referred to as the S1 CTD or domain B. Either the S1 NTD or S1 RBD, or occasionally both, are involved in binding to host receptors. S1 NTD is located on the side of the spike trimer and mainly recognises sugar receptors [2]. For many betacoronaviruses (b-CoVs), for example mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the RBD is located in the NTD. The structure of the MHV S1 NTD showed the same fold as human galectins (galactose-binding lectin), however it does not bind any sugar; instead, it binds to the carcinoembryonic antigen cell-adhesion molecule CEACAM1) through protein-protein interactions [2]. All three CEACAM21a-binding sites in MHV spikes can be fully occupied by CEACAM1a. It has been shown that CEACAM1a binding to the MHV spike weakens the interactions between S1 and S2 and facilitates the proteolysis of the spike protein and dissociation of S1 [2]. The homologous bovine CoV (BCov) S1 NTD also possesses a galectin fold but binds to sialic acid-containing moieties on host cell membranes, as does the NTD of three other group A b-Covs, namely human CoV (HCoV) OC43, avian b-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [3]. Despite the S1 NTD of human respiratory b-CoV HKU1 being highly homologous to the NTDs of MHV and bovine CoV, it does not bind to either sugar or human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and the RBD is found instead in the S1 RBD domain [3].
AAA_19	PF13245	AAA domain	
dsrm	PF00035	Double-stranded RNA binding motif	Sequences gathered for seed by HMM_iterative_training Putative motif shared by proteins that bind to dsRNA. At least some DSRM proteins seem to bind to specific RNA targets. Exemplified by Staufen, which is involved in localisation of at least five different mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo. Also by interferon-induced protein kinase in humans, which is part of the cellular response to dsRNA.
AAA_12	PF13087	AAA domain	This family of domains contain a P-loop motif that is characteristic of the AAA superfamily. Many of the proteins in this family are conjugative transfer proteins.
bCoV_SUD_M	PF11633	Betacoronavirus single-stranded poly(A) binding domain	This domain identifies non-structural protein NSP3, the product of ORF1a in group 2 coronavirus. It is found in human SARS coronavirus polyprotein 1a and 1ab, and in related coronavirus polyproteins [1]. NSP3 binds to viral RNA, nucleocapsid protein, as well as other viral proteins, and participates in polyprotein processing [2]. The domain exhibits a macrodomain fold containing the nsp3 residues 528 to 648, with a flexibly extended N-terminal tail from residues 513 to 527 and a C-terminal flexible tail of residues 649 to 651. SUD-M(527-651) binds single-stranded poly(A); the contact area with this RNA on the protein surface, and the electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirm that SUD-M has higher affinity for purine bases than for pyrimidine bases [3].
CoV_NSP9	PF08710	Coronavirus replicase NSP9	Nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding viral protein involved in RNA synthesis [1]. Several crystallographic structures of nsp9 have shown that it is composed of seven beta strands and a single alpha helix. Nsp9 proteins have N-finger motifs and highly conserved GXXXG motifs that both play critical roles in dimerisation [2]. The conserved helix-helix dimer interface containing a GXXXG protein-protein interaction motif is biologically relevant to SARS-CoV replication.
CoV_NSP3_C	PF19218	Coronavirus replicase NSP3, C-terminal	This family represents the C-terminal region of non-structural protein NSP3 (also known as nsp3). NSP3 is the product of ORF1a. It is found in human SARS coronavirus polyprotein 1a and 1ab, and in related coronavirus polyproteins. It is a multifunctional protein comprising up to 16 different domains and regions. NSP3 binds to viral RNA, nucleocapsid protein, as well as other viral proteins and participates in polyprotein processing [1].
RdRP_1	PF00680	Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase	This family represents the RNA-directed RNA polymerase found in many positive strand RNA eukaryotic viruses. Structural studies indicate that these proteins form the "right hand" structure found in all oligonucleotide polymerases, containing thumb, finger and palm domains, and also the additional bridging finger and thumb domains unique to RNA-directed RNA polymerases [1,2,3,4]. Remdesivir, a recent treatment approved for Covid-19 disease, directly interacts with this region of the RdRp (NSP12) from SARS-CoV-2 and explains its mechanism of action via delayed-chain termination [5].
CoV_S2	PF01601	Coronavirus spike glycoprotein S2	The coronavirus spike glycoprotein forms the characteristic 'corona' after which the group is named. The Spike glycoprotein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved to S1 Pfam:PF01600 and S2 [1], [2]. The S2 subunit normally contains multiple key components, including one or more fusion peptides (FP), a second proteolytic site (S2') and two conserved heptad repeats (HRs), driving membrane penetration and virus-cell fusion. The HRs can trimerize into a coiled-coil structure built of three HR1-HR2 helical hairpins presenting as a canonical six-helix bundle and drag the virus envelope and the host cell bilayer into close proximity, preparing for fusion to occur [3].
CoV_RPol_N	PF06478	Coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N-terminal	This domain covers the N-terminal region of the coronavirus RNA-directed RNA Polymerase which corresponds to the nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12) produced by cleavage of ORF1b. NSP12 contains a polymerase domain that assumes a structure resembling a cupped 'right hand', similar to other polymerases, containing a fingers domain, a palm domain and a thumb domain. Coronavirus NSP12 also contains a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) that possesses a kinase-like fold allowing the binding of NSP12 to NSP7 and NSP8. NSP12 possesses some minimal activity on its own, but the addition of the NSP7 and NSP8 co-factors greatly stimulates polymerase activity [1,2,3,4]. This domain represents the N-terminal region of the coronavirus RNA-directed RNA Polymerase, which includes the NiRAN and interface domains [1,4]. The function of the NiRAN domain is not clear and its target is yet unknown, but it has enzymatic activity that is essential for viral propagation. Structure from SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this domain binds ADP-Mg+2, which may constitute a new pocket for anti-viral treatment development [5].
Peptidase_C30	PF05409	Coronavirus endopeptidase C30	This Coronavirus (CoV) domain, peptidase C30, is also known as 3C-like proteinase (3CL-pro), or CoV main protease (M-pro) domain. CoV M-pro (alsp known as non-structural protein 5, NSP5) is a dimer where each subunit is composed of three domains I, II and III [1,2,3]. Domains I and II consist of six-stranded antiparallel beta barrels and together resemble the architecture of chymotrypsin, and of picornaviruses 3C proteinases. The substrate-binding site is located in a cleft between these two domains. The catalytic site is situated at the centre of the cleft. A long loop connects domain II to the C-terminal domain (domain III). This latter domain has been implicated in the proteolytic activity of M-pro. In the active site of M-pro, Cys and His form a catalytic dyad [4,5]. In contrast to serine proteinases and other cysteine proteinases, which have a catalytic triad, there is no third catalytic residue present [6]. This peptidase is involved in viral polyprotein processing during replication [2,3,5].
bCoV_NSP1	PF11501	Betacoronavirus replicase NSP1	This entry represents the non structural protein NSP1 from Betacoronavirus NSP1 is the N-terminal cleavage product from the viral replicase that mediates RNA replication and processing [1]. Structurally, the protein consists of a mixed parallel/antiparallel 6-stranded beta barrel with an alpha helix covering one end of the barrel and another helix alongside the barrel [1]. NSP1 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation, and it also induces a template-dependent endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs [2,3]. NSP1 also suppresses the host innate immune functions by inhibiting type I interferon expression and host antiviral signalling pathways [4,5].
CoV_NSP4_C	PF16348	Coronavirus replicase NSP4, C-terminal	This is the C-terminal domain of the coronavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4). NSP4 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. It is a membrane-spanning protein which is thought to anchor the viral replication-transcription complex (RTC) to modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This predominantly alpha-helical domain may be involved in protein-protein interactions [1]. It has been shown that in Betacoronavirus, the coexpression of NSP3 and NSP4 results in a membrane rearrangement to induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), playing a critical role in SARS-CoV replication. There are two well conserved amino acid residues (H120 and F121) in NSP4 among Betacoronavirus, essential for membrane rearrangements during interaction with NSP3 [2,3].
CoV_ExoN	PF06471	Coronavirus proofreading exoribonuclease	This region of coronavirus polyproteins encodes the NSP14 protein. Its N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) domain plays a proofreading role for prevention of lethal mutagenesis, and the C-terminal domain functions as a (guanine-N7) methyl transferase (N7-MTase) for mRNA capping. NSP14 forms the nsp14-nsp10 complex involved in RNA viral proofreading [1,2,3,4]. This association stimulates its ExoN activity. There are not yet publicly available structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP14, but computed homology model based on the structure of SARS-CoV-1 NSP14 (PDB:5C8S) revealed that they share ~95% sequence identity [2].
CoV_NSP15_N	PF19219	Coronavirus replicase NSP15, N-terminal oligomerisation	This is the N-terminal domain of the coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15), which is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. NSP15, is a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) carrying C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the EndoU family. The SARS-CoV-2 NendoU monomers assemble into a double-ring hexamer, generated by a dimer of trimers. The hexamer is stabilized by the interactions of N-terminal oligomerization domain.
CoV_nucleocap	PF00937	Coronavirus nucleocapsid	Coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid (N) proteins have 3 highly conserved domains. The N-terminal domain (NTD) (N1b), the C-terminal domain (CTD)(N2b) and the N3 region. The N1b and N2b domains from SARS CoV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human CoV 229E and mouse hepatic virus (MHV) display similar topological organisations. N proteins form dimers, which are asymmetrically arranged into octamers via their N2b domains. Domains N1b and N2b are linked by another domain N2a that contains an SR-rich region in which phosphorylation of specific serine residues allows the N protein to associate with the RNA helicase DDX1 permitting template read-through, and enabling the transition from discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) to continuous synthesis of longer sgmRNAs and genomic RNA (gRNA)[1], [2], [3]. It has been shown that N proteins interact with nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) and thus are recruited to the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) [1].
Hema_HEFG	PF02710	Hemagglutinin domain of haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein	
IBV_3B	PF03622	IBV 3B protein	Product of ORF 3B from Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Currently, the function of this protein remains unknown [1].
LAP1_C	PF05609	Lamina-associated polypeptide 1, AAA+ activator domain	Torsin-1A-interacting proteins 1 and 2 (TOIP 1/2), also known as LAP1 proteins (Lamina-associated polypeptide 1) are type 2 integral membrane proteins with a single membrane-spanning region of the inner nuclear membrane [1,2]. These proteins interact with and activate Torsin A, an AAA+ ATPase localised to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a perinuclear domain and forms a heterohexameric (LAP1-Torsin)3 ring that targets Torsin to the nuclear envelope. LAP1 has an atypical AAA+ fold and provides an arginine finger to the Torsin A active site to promote its ATPase activity [3,4]. A single mutation in Torsin A causes early onset primary dystonia, a painful and severely disabling neuromuscular disease [3,4]. This entry represents the C-terminal AAA+ activator domain of LAP1.
CoV_E	PF02723	Coronavirus small envelope protein E	This family includes E proteins, well conserved among Coronavirus strains. They are small, integral membrane proteins involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis [1]. They act as a viroporin by oligomerizing after insertion in host membranes to create a hydrophilic pore that allows ion transport [2,3]. SARS-CoV E protein forms a Ca2+ permeable channel in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi membranes. The E protein ion channel activity alters Ca2+ homeostasis within cells boosting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the overproduction of IL-beta. SARS-CoV overstimulates the NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway, triggering p38 MARK activation [4]. CoV E proteins have a short hydrophilic N terminus, followed by a large hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domain, and end with a long, hydrophilic C-terminal which comprises the majority of the protein. The hydrophobic region of the TM domain contains at least one predicted amphipathic alpha-helix that pentamerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes. CoV E proteins are involved in the secretory pathway, altering lumenal environments and rearranging secretory organelles and leading to efficient trafficking of virions, and they may also play a role protein-protein interactions and targeting, among other roles [5,6,7].
bCoV_S1_RBD	PF09408	Betacoronavirus spike glycoprotein S1, receptor binding	This entry represents the receptor binding domain (S1 RBD) of the betacoronavirus spike glycoprotein. The spike glycoprotein is arranged in trimers on the surface of the viral membrane and is essential for viral entry. The spike protein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved to the distal S1, responsible for receptor binding, and the membrane-anchored S2 responsible for membrane fusion [1]. The coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S1 subunit is composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (S1 NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD) also referred to as the S1 CTD or domain B. Each of these domains have been implicated in binding to host receptors. However, most coronaviruses are not known to utilise both the S1 NTD and S1 RBD for viral entry [2]. SARS-CoV makes use of its S1 RBD to bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor [3,4].
bCoV_NS6	PF12133	Betacoronavirus NS6 protein	This entry represents non-structural protein NS6 (also known as non-structural protein 6, accessory protein 6, or X3 protein), which is highly conserved among SARS-related coronaviruses [2]. (This is distinct from NSP6 which is encoded on the replicase polyprotein). Proteins in this family are typically between 42 to 63 amino acids in length. NS6 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum [2]. It has been reported that NS6 can increase the cellular gene synthesis and it can also induce apoptosis through Jun N-terminal kinase and Caspase-3 mediated stress. This protein can modulate host antiviral responses by inhibiting synthesis and signalling of IFN-beta, via NS6 interaction with host N-Myc (and STAT) interactor (Nmi) protein and suppressing the translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) [3].
CoV_NSP10	PF09401	Coronavirus RNA synthesis protein NSP10	Non-structural protein 10 (NSP10) is involved in RNA synthesis. It is synthesised as a polyprotein whose cleavage generates many non-structural proteins. NSP10 contains two zinc binding motifs and forms two anti-parallel helices which are stacked against an irregular beta sheet [1,6]. A cluster of basic residues on the protein surface suggests a nucleic acid-binding function. NSP10 interacts with NSP14 and NSP16 and regulates their respective ExoN and 2-O-MTase activities [2]. When binding to the N-terminal of NSP14, NSP10 allows the ExoN active site to adopt a stably closed conformation [3] and is an allosteric regulator that stabilizes NSP16. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 NSP10/NSP16 heterodimer revealed that it is extremely similar to that of its SARS-CoV-1 homologue [5]. One NSP10 residue, Tyr-96 is of particular interest as it plays a crucial role in the NSP10-NSP16/NSP14 interaction. This residue is specific for SARS-CoV NSP10 and is a phenylalanine in most other Coronavirus homologues [4].
AAA_30	PF13604	AAA domain	This family of domains contain a P-loop motif that is characteristic of the AAA superfamily. Many of the proteins in this family are conjugative transfer proteins. There is a Walker A and Walker B.
CoV_M	PF01635	Coronavirus M matrix/glycoprotein	This family consists of various coronavirus matrix proteins which are transmembrane glycoproteins [1]. The membrane (M) protein is the most abundant structural protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope, being the central organiser of coronavirus assembly. M proteins play a critical role in protein-protein interactions (as well as protein-RNA interactions) since virus-like particle (VLP) formation in many CoVs requires only the M and envelope (E) proteins for efficient virion assembly [2]. Interaction of spike (S) with M is necessary for retention of S in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)/Golgi complex and its incorporation into new virions; binding of M to nucleocapsid (N) proteins stabilises the nucleocapsid. Together, M and E protein make up the viral envelope and their interaction is sufficient for the production and release of virus-like particles (VLPs)[3].
CoV_NSP15_C	PF19215	Coronavirus replicase NSP15, uridylate-specific endoribonuclease	This entry represents the C-terminal domain of coronavirus non-structural protein 15 (NSP15 or nsp15). NSP15 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. This domain exhibits endoribonuclease activity designated EndoU, highly conserved in all known CoVs and is part of the replicase-transcriptase complex that plays important roles in virus replication and transcription [1, 2, 3]. NSP15 is a Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves the 5'-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA either upstream or downstream of uridylates, at GUU or GU to produce molecules with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate ends [2, 3]. PUN RNA is a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [3].
Corona_NS2A	PF05213	Coronavirus NS2A protein	This family contains a number of corona virus non-structural proteins of unknown function. The family also includes a polymerase protein fragment from Berne virus and does not seem to be related to the Pfam:PF04753 Coronavirus NS2 family. This family is part of the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily [1].
CoV_NSP7	PF08716	Coronavirus replicase NSP7	NSP7 (non structural protein 7) has been implicated in viral RNA replication and is predominantly alpha helical in structure [1]. It forms a hexadecameric supercomplex with NSP8 that adopts a hollow cylinder-like structure [2]. The dimensions of the central channel and positive electrostatic properties of the cylinder imply that it confers processivity on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [2]. NSP7 and NSP8 heterodimers play a role in the stabilisation of NSP12 regions involved in RNA binding and are essential for a highly active NSP12 polymerase complex [3].
CoV_NSP13_ZBD	PF20632	Coronavirus Non-structural protein 13, zinc-binding domain	Helicase nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13) is encoded by the replicase polyprotein 1a/ab of coronaviruses and released after a proteolytic process. It plays a critical role catalysing the unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in an NTP-dependent manner. It In SARS-CoV, it has been shown that NSP12 directly interacts with NSP13 and enhances its helicase activity. It is a multidomain protein consisting of a N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a stalk domain that connects the ZBD with the 1B domain and the helicase domain (that contains two RecA1 and RecA2 domains). ZBD, stalk and 1B domains are unique to nidovirus helicases [1]. NSP13 adopts a triangular pyramid shape in which the two RecA1 and A2 and 1B domains form the triangular base while N-terminal ZBD and stalk domains are arranged at the apex of the pyramid [1,2]. Recently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 as an interferon antagonist [3]. This is the zinc-binding domain (ZBD) found at the N-terminal of NSP13 which is critically involved in nidovirus replication and transcription, modulating the ATPase/helicase activity in cis [1,2]. It includes conserved cysteines and histidines involved in three zinc-binding sites [4].
AAA_11	PF13086	AAA domain	This family of domains contain a P-loop motif that is characteristic of the AAA superfamily. Many of the proteins in this family are conjugative transfer proteins.
CoV_NSP6	PF19213	Coronavirus replicase NSP6	This entry represents proteins found in Coronaviruses and includes the Non-structural Protein 6 (NSP6). Coronaviruses encode large replicase polyproteins which are proteolytically processed by viral proteases to generate mature Nonstructural Proteins (NSPs) [1]. NSP6 is a membrane protein containing 6 transmembrane domains with a large C-terminal tail [1]. NSP6 from the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have been shown to localise to the ER and to generate autophagosomes [2]. Coronavirus NSP6 proteins have also been shown to limit autophagosome expansion. This may favour coronavirus infection by reducing the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation [2]. NSP6 from IBV, MHV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have also been found to activate autophagy [2,3].
CoV_peptidase	PF08715	Coronavirus papain-like peptidase	This entry contains coronavirus cysteine endopeptidases that belong to MEROPS peptidase family C16 and are required for proteolytic processing of the replicase polyprotein. All coronaviruses encode between one and two accessory cysteine proteinases that recognise and process one or two sites in the amino-terminal half of the replicase polyprotein during assembly of the viral replication complex. HCoV and TGEV encode two accessory proteinases, called coronavirus papain-like proteinase 1 and 2 (PL1-PRO and PL2-PRO). IBV and SARS encodes only one called PL-PRO [1-5]. They also function as deubiquitinating and deISG15ylating (interferon-induced gene 15) enzymes, disrupting host viral immune response to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Therefore, this is an important target to develop antiviral treatments [4]. The peptidase family C16 domain is about 260 amino acids in length and structures revealed that it adopts a fold similar that of de-ubiquitinating enzymes [2,4]. Structures from SARS-CoV-2 determined that it consists of thumb, palm, and fingers subdomains. The thumb is comprised of six alpha-helices and a small beta-hairpin; the fingers subdomain is made of six beta-strands and two alpha-helices and includes a zinc binding site, in which the zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteine residues. Zinc binding is essential for structural integrity and protease activity, with a conformation that varies most between different PL-PRO structures. The palm subdomain is comprised of six beta-strands and includes the catalytic residues Cys-His-Asp, located at the interface between the thumb and palm subdomains [4,5].
CoV_NSP15_M	PF19216	Coronavirus replicase NSP15, middle domain	This entry represents the non-catalytic middle domain from coronavirus non-structural protein 15 (NSP15). NSP15 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. This domain is formed by ten beta strands organised into three beta hairpins [1, 2].
Hema_esterase	PF03996	Hemagglutinin esterase	
PRK	PF00485	Phosphoribulokinase / Uridine kinase family	This family matches three types of P-loop containing kinases: phosphoribulokinases [1], uridine kinases [2] and bacterial pantothenate kinases(CoaA) [3]. Arabidopsis and other organisms have a dual uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase protein where the N-terminal region consists of a UK domain and the C-terminal region of a UPRT domain [4].
CoV_NSP4_N	PF19217	Coronavirus replicase NSP4, N-terminal	This is the N-terminal domain of the coronavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4). NSP4 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein. NSP4 is a membrane-spanning protein which is thought to anchor the viral replication-transcription complex to modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This N-terminal region represents the membrane spanning region, covering four transmembrane regions [1].
IBV_3C	PF03620	IBV 3C protein	Product of ORF 3C from Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Currently, the function of this protein remains unknown.
bCoV_NSP3_N	PF12379	Betacoronavirus replicase NSP3, N-terminal	This domain family corresponds to the N-terminal domain of NSP3 (non-structural protein 3, also known as nsp3) found in Betacoronavirus, which is encoded on the replicase polyprotein. This family includes the NSP3a domain which has the ubiquitin-like 1 (UB1) and glutamic acid-rich acidic (AC) hypervariable domains [1]. NSP3a interacts with numerous other proteins involved in replication and transcription and may serve as a scaffolding protein for these processes. The N-terminal NSP3a domain interacts with N (nucleocapsid) protein to colocalise genomic RNA with the nascent replicase-transcriptase complex at the earliest stages of infection, essential for the virus [3]. The C-terminal Glu-rich subdomain is best described as a flexible tail attached to the globular UB1 subdomain [4]. The family is found in association with Pfam:PF08716, Pfam:PF01661, Pfam:PF05409, Pfam:PF06471, Pfam:PF08717, Pfam:PF06478, Pfam:PF09401, Pfam:PF06460, Pfam:PF08715, Pfam:PF08710.
Viral_helicase1	PF01443	Viral (Superfamily 1) RNA helicase	Helicase activity for this family has been demonstrated [1] and NTPase activity [2]. This helicase has multiple roles at different stages of viral RNA replication, as dissected by mutational analysis [3].
Astro_capsid_p	PF12226	Turkey astrovirus capsid protein	This family of proteins is found in viruses. Proteins in this family are typically between 241 and 261 amino acids in length. These proteins are capsid proteins from various astrovirus strains.
NSP2_gammaCoV	PF17896	Non-structural protein 2, gammacoronavirus	Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus that belongs to Group III of coronaviruses. They have a large genome containing the replicase gene consisting of two large ORFs, ORF1a and 1b that encode two replicase polyproteins ppa1a/1ab, which are then auto-proteolytically processed into 15 or 16 matured nonstructural proteins to achieve viral genomic replication, assembly and maturation. This group contains avian viruses and differs from the other groups in that they do not encode the essential pathogenic factor non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) and instead start with NSP2. IBV NSP2 is one of the first replicase proteins to be translated and processed in the viral life cycle [1]. NSP2 is a weak protein kinase R (PKR) antagonist, which may suggest that it plays a role in interfering with intracellular immunity [2].
bCoV_viroporin	PF11289	Betacoronavirus viroporin	This entry represents protein 3a encoded by Orf3/3a, also known as X1, which forms homotetrameric potassium, sodium or calcium sensitive ion channels (viroporin) that causes ER-stress in host cells and may modulate virus release. This is a pro-apoptosis-inducing protein that localises to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment. SARS-CoV causes apoptosis of infected cells through NLRP3 inflammasome activation [1,2,3,4]. Protein 3a also promotes the ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) mediated by its interaction with TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). This protein induces NF-kappa B activation and upregulates fibrinogen secretion with high cytokine production [5]. Through the activation of the PERK pathway of unfolded protein response (UPR), this protein causes phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha leading to reduced translation of cellular proteins and as the activation of pro-apoptotic downstream effectors (i.e ATF4, CHOP).
CoV_NSP2_C	PF19212	Coronavirus replicase NSP2, C-terminal	This entry corresponds to a presumed domain found at the C-terminus of Coronavirus non-structural protein 2 (NSP2). NSP2 is encoded by ORF1a/1ab and proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein and its function is unclear. Viral-host protein interaction studies in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 found that this protein could interact with several host proteins, including prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2, which are implicated in a number of cellular functions, including cellular migration, differentiation and apoptosis [2,3]. This presumed domain is found in two copies in some viral NSP2 proteins. This domain is found in both alpha and betacoronaviruses.
bCoV_NS8	PF12093	Betacoronavirus NS8 protein	This family of proteins includes the accessory proteins encoded by the ORF8 in coronaviruses, also known as accessory protein 8, or non-structural protein 8 (NS8). This is distinct from NSP8, which is encoded on the replicase polyprotein. Proteins in this family are typically between 39 to 121 amino acids in length. This protein has two conserved sequence motifs: EDPCP and INCQ. It may modulate viral pathogenicity or replication in favour of human adaptation. ORF8 was suggested as one of the relevant genes in the study of human adaptation of the virus [1,2]. This entry includes the NS8a and NS8b proteins from human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Recently, the the structure of SARS-CoV-2 ORF has been determined and revealed a core of approximately 60 residues similar to SARS-CoV ORF7a, the Ig-like fold, with the addition of two dimerisation interfaces unique to SARS-CoV-2 ORF8. It forms a covalent disulfide-linker dimer through an N-terminal sequence specific to SARS-CoV-2 and a separate non-covalent interface is formed by another SARS-CoV-2 specific sequence. The presence of these interfaces shows that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 can form unique large-scale assemblies not possible for SARS-CoV, potentially mediating unique immune suppression and evasion activities [3,4].
Corona_6B_7B	PF03262	Coronavirus 6B/7B protein	
bCoV_SUD_C	PF12124	Betacoronavirus SUD-C domain	This domain is found in betacoronavirus non-structural protein NSP3, and is about 65 amino acids in length. It was originally thought to exist only in SARS-coronaviruses, and so was termed the SARS-unique domain (SUD), however this has since been shown to be incorrect. The domain is also known as DPUP (domain preceding Ubl2 and PL2pro). NSP3 is the product of ORF1a, proteolytically released from the pp1a/1ab polyprotein [1,2]. The SUD domain has three globular domains, SUD-N (N-terminal), SUD-M (middle region of SUD), and SUD-C (C-terminal). SUD-C adopts a fold consisting of seven beta-strands arranged in an anti-parallel beta-sheet, and two alpha-helices which are packed against the same side of the beta-sheet. It adopts a frataxin like fold with structural similarities to DNA-binding domains. It has been shown that SUD-C binds to single-stranded RNA and recognises purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, but these interactions are stabilised in the presence of SUD-M. The function of this domain is not clear but studies of structural homologues of SUD-C suggest that it could be related to metal, adenylate and nucleic acid binding [3].
CNV-Replicase_N	PF16688	Replicase polyprotein N-term from Coronavirus nsp1	CNV-Replicase_N is the N-terminal domain of a family of ssRNA positive-stranded porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronaviruses. the domain folds into a six-stranded beta-barrel fold with a long alpha helix on the rim of the barrel. This fold is shared with SARS-CoV nsp1 [1].
Peptidase_C16	PF01831	Peptidase C16 family	
CoV_NSP13_1B	PF20631	Coronavirus Nonstructural protein 13, 1B domain	Helicase nonstructural protein 13 (NSP13) is encoded by the replicase polyprotein 1a/ab of coronaviruses and released after a proteolytic process. It plays a critical role catalysing the unwinding of duplex oligonucleotides into single strands in an NTP-dependent manner. It is a multidomain protein consisting of a N-terminal zinc-binding domain (ZBD), a stalk domain that connects the ZBD with the 1B domain and the helicase domain (that contains two RecA1 and RecA2 domains). ZBD, stalk and 1B domains are unique to nidovirus helicases [1]. NSP13 adopts a triangular pyramid shape in which the two RecA1 and A2 and 1B domains form the triangular base while N-terminal ZBD and stalk domains are arranged at the apex of the pyramid [1,2]. Recently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 as an interferon antagonist [3]. This is 1B domain of NSP13 [1], which has a regulatory role modulating the nucleic acid substrate binding [2].
Corona_3	PF04694	Coronavirus ORF3 protein	
Corona_NS12-7	PF04753	Coronavirus non-structural protein NS12.7 family	This entry corresponds to a non-structural protein found in some beta coronaviruses. It is known as the NS12.7 family after its predicted molecular weight. The function of this protein is unknown.
Acc5b_avian_CoV	PF05528	Accessory protein 5b, avian coronavirus	Avian infectious bronchitis virus, a member of Coronaviridae family, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 27 kb in length. Gene 5 contains two (5a and 5b) open reading frames [1]. This entry represents the host translation inhibitor 5b (ORF 5b, also known as accessory protein 5b) which is involved in host translation shut off without degrading host RNA. It suppresses host gene expression which facilitates evasion from host type I interferon immune response [2].
Corona_NS3b	PF03053	ORF3b coronavirus protein	Members of this family are non-structural proteins, approximately 250 amino acid residues long. They are found in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) isolates. These proteins are found on the same mRNA as another product, designated ORF3a. While ORF3a/b has been implicated in TGEV and PRCV pathogenesis, its precise role remains unclear (see [2,3]).
Macro	PF01661	Macro domain	The Macro or A1pp domain is a module of about 180 amino acids which can bind ADP-ribose (an NAD metabolite) or related ligands. Binding to ADP-ribose could be either covalent or non-covalent [1]: in certain cases it is believed to bind non-covalently [2]; while in other cases (such as Aprataxin) it appears to bind both non-covalently through a zinc finger motif, and covalently through a separate region of the protein [3]. This domain is found in a number of otherwise unrelated proteins. It is found at the C-terminus of the macro-H2A histone protein 4 and also in the non-structural proteins of several types of ssRNA viruses such as NSP3 from alpha-viruses and coronaviruses. This domain is also found on its own in a family of proteins from bacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes. The 3D structure of the SARS-CoV Macro domain has a mixed alpha/beta fold consisting of a central seven-stranded twisted mixed beta sheet sandwiched between two alpha helices on one face, and three on the other. The final alpha-helix, located on the edge of the central beta-sheet, forms the C terminus of the protein [4]. The crystal structure of AF1521 (a Macro domain-only protein from Archaeoglobus fulgidus) has also been reported and compared with other Macro domain containing proteins. Several Macro domain only proteins are shorter than AF1521, and appear to lack either the first strand of the beta-sheet or the C-terminal helix 5. Well conserved residues form a hydrophobic cleft and cluster around the AF1521-ADP-ribose binding site [5].
bCoV_NAB	PF16251	Betacoronavirus nucleic acid-binding (NAB)	This is the nucleic acid-binding domain (NAB) from the multidomain nonstructural protein NSP3, and described as NSP3e domain. NSP3 is part of Orf1a polyproteins in SARS-CoV [1]. It is an essential component of the replication/transcription complex [2]. The global domain of the NAB represents a new fold, with a parallel four-strand beta-sheet holding two alpha-helices of three and four turns that are oriented antiparallel to the beta-strands and a group of residues form a positively charged patch on the protein surface as the binding site responsible for binding affinity for nucleic acids. When binding to ssRNA, the NAB prefers sequences with repeats of three consecutive Gs, such as (GGGA)5 and (GGGA)2. A positively charged surface patch (Lys75, Lys76, Lys99, and Arg106) is involved in RNA binding [2,3,4].
Corona_5a	PF06336	Coronavirus 5a protein	This family consists of several Coronavirus 5a proteins. The function of this family is unknown [1].
CoV_S1	PF01600	Coronavirus spike glycoprotein S1	This family represents the spike glycoprotein (S) of coronaviruses. The spike protein is arranged in trimers on the surface of the viral membrane and is essential for viral entry. The spike protein is translated as a large polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved to the distal S1, responsible for receptor binding, and the membrane-anchored S2 responsible for membrane fusion [1]. The coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S1 subunit is composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (S1 NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (S1 RBD) also referred to as the S1 CTD or domain B. Each of these domains have been implicated in binding to host receptors. However, most coronaviruses are not known to utilise both the S1 NTD and S1 RBD for viral entry [2]. This entry contains spike protein from both alpha and gamma coronaviruses but excludes the spike protein from beta-coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV.
Corona_7	PF02398	Coronavirus protein 7	This is a family of proteins from coronavirus which may function in viral assembly.
CoV_NSP8	PF08717	Coronavirus replicase NSP8	Viral NSP8 (non structural protein 8) forms a hexadecameric supercomplex with NSP7 that adopts a hollow cylinder-like structure [1]. The dimensions of the central channel and positive electrostatic properties of the cylinder imply that it confers processivity on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [1]. NSP7 and NSP8 heterodimers play a role in the stabilisation of NSP12 regions involved in RNA binding and are essential for a highly active NSP12 polymerase complex [2]. It has been demonstrated that NSP8 acts as an oligo(U)-templated polyadenylyltransferase but also has robust (mono/oligo) adenylate transferase activities [3]. NSP8 has N- and C-terminal D/ExD/E conserved motifs, being the N-terminal motif critical for RNA polymerase activity as these residues are part of the Mg2-binding active site [4].
Corona_NS4	PF03905	Coronavirus non-structural protein NS4	
bCoV_NS7A	PF08779	Betacoronavirus NS7A protein	This entry corresponds to the Human SARS virus NS7A protein (also known as 7a, accessory protein 7a, X4 and U122). The structure of this protein shows similarities to the immunoglobulin like fold and a known member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain superfamily [9,10], which suggests a binding activity to integrin I domains [1]. In SARS-CoV-infected cells, the NS7A protein is expressed and retained intra-cellularly within the Golgi network [2]. NS7A has been implicated to function during the replication cycle of SARS-CoV [3].
